This project is dedicated to the person who managed in a short time to teach me many things 
that I did not know yet, and for which it is developed based on a promise of flight. 
The promises are never forgotten.

Description,
This project is shown under fully empirical design and execution 
directives and basic knowledge of software and electronics engineering, 
with a vision to become one of the most successful mobility solutions 
for a medium-term future in a mega-city environment.
